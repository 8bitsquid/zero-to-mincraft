# From Zero to Minecraft
Computer science and Java crash course to work your way up making advanced Minecraft mods.

## Syllabus

This course is intended to give basic knowledge and background to learning Java and applying those skills to Minecraft mods. It does not include in-depth knowledge of Computer Science as a whole.

### Section 1 - Intro to Computer & Programming Fundamentals

#### Questions and Excercises

1.  Fill in the appropriate data type for each variable:
    * __ num = 20;
    * __ num = 20.123;
    * __ isNum = false;
    * __ isNum = "false";

2.  Create an array of 10 letters 

### Section 3 - Control Flow Statements

### Reading Material
* [Control Flow Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html)
* [The if-then and if-then-else Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/if.html)
* [The switch Statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html)
* [The while and do-while Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/while.html)
* [The for Statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html)

#### Questions and Excercises

1. Consider the following code snippet.
```java
if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
else System.out.println("second string");
System.out.println("third string");
```
*   What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?
*   Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 3. What is the output of the program? Is it what you predicted? Explain why the output is what it is; in other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet?
*   Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow easier to understand.
*   Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code.

2. Write a `switch` statement with at least 3 conditions for the variable below that will output the string `The variable is ____`. If the variable value does not match any of the `switch` conditions, print out `No idea what a ____ is`
```java
// fill in test values here
string s = ""

//.... write switch here
```

3. Write two identical loops that print out numbers 1 - 10, using `for` and `while` loops.
